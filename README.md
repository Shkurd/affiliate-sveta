1. To clone a project: "git clone https://github.com/Shkurd/affiliate-sveta.git"
2. To Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder: "npm install"

For example: "http://localhost:3000/src/healthy-fit-happy/" => "http://localhost:3000/healthy-fit-happy/"
Then you can see the page.
Or open the page after launching at the desired url.
For example: "http://localhost:3000/healthy-fit-happy/"
